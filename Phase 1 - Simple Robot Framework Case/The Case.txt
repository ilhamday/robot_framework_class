I am a farmer that have 5 cucumbers. On the way I met a deer, and the deer ate 2 of my cucumbers. I now have 3 cucumbers left.

Scenario: Pick the cucumber
Given the farmer on the cucumber field
When the farmer put the goods to basket
Then the goods should be in the basket

Scenario: Back to house
Given the farmer walk on the road
When the deer is shown
And the deer eat the goods from the basket
Then the goods are reduced

Scenario: Meet the deer
Given cucumber is in the basket # diubah biar langsung dari kondisi sebelumnya
When the deer eat the goods from the basket # ketika rusa makan timun, pasti dia udah langsung muncul
Then the goods are reduced
